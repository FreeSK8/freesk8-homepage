Hello! We're the (small) team developing FreeSK8 - an open source hardware and software reference platform providing all necessary power, motor control, lighting, navigation, logging and wireless control under one OS umbrella. Open reference specs of all included devices will be published under various free and open software licenses such as GPL GNU v3, CC BY-SA 4.0, etc. 

**What's new?**

## FreeSK8 Codex

The codex is live and serves as a central source of documentation for all things FreeSK8.

## FreeSK8 Mobile Public Beta

After a year and a half of development and feedback from our private beta testing group the mobile application is ready to go public. Documentation, source code and downloads on Play and App Stores are available to all.
