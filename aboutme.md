FreeSK8 Foundation is a passion project; a group of friends, engineers, & skaters brought together by shared goals & philosophies about what we wanted to create and how we wanted to bring it to the DIY eBoarding Community. 

FreeSK8 is an open source, comprehensive eboarding & LEV system comprised of multiple devices that communicate with each other to provide critical system sensor & fault data to the rider & other system components. These systems are comprised of an ESC (Electronic Speed Controller, VESC-Compatible), Radio Module/Datalogger/BLE Module ([Robogotchi](https://codex.freesk8.org/docs/robogotchi/)), Wireless Remote Control ([FreeSK8 Remote/OSRR 1.0](https://codex.freesk8.org/docs/osrr/)), GPS, SmartBMS (Battery Management System), Power Control (AntiSpark/power switch), Lighting Control System (LightShow Module), & various technologies.

We are committed to the open source philosophy of sharing knowledge & technology. This means that we want the FreeSK8 project to grow beyond just one team’s efforts and be a public asset that is available to all. In addition to publishing project documentation, source code, design files, schematics, & tutorials- our long-term goal is to stand up The FreeSK8 Foundation as a 501©3 Non-Profit Organization.

All involved with this effort believe in the power of freedom of information & open source philosophy. We feel that transparency in intentions provide personal & public accountability as we move into a new era of business ethics & consumer rights advocacy.

For those familiar with the Open Source world: [Prusa Research SRO](https://www.prusa3d.com/) & [Sparkfun](https://derelictrobot.com/pages/sparkfun.com) serve as HUGE inspirations for the business model we aspire to follow. These guys are absolute champions to the cause & all involved with this effort owe a lot to their generosity & commitment to OS.
